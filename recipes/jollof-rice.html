<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Now, the webpage from which I borrowed this jollof rice recipe has its own description. The reason why this recipe features on my website? Because jollof rice is freaking amazing. Nigerian jollof rice, to be exact. If you wanted Ghanian jollof rice, I suggest
you stop reading. Being Nigerian, jollof rice is one of those foods that if you haven't had, you can't really call your self Nigerian, or African for that matter. The way my mom taught me to make this dish was long and exhausting, so this is a great way for me
to try out other methods of preparing this wonderful, delicious, excellent, cultured, <em>precious</em> dish. And for those that prefer Ghanian jollof rice and are still reading this webpage, you make this yourself. See if you don't like it better than the trash
you call jollof. Total preparation of this will take about an hour and fifteen minutes, most of which is just letting the rice boil. The rest? Worth it when you do it and taste the food for the first time. Thank you, Eleanor Ajouku, for making this Yoruba boy
very happy.
